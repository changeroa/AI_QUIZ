# Security Update Instructions

## ðŸ”’ Fixing NPM Audit Vulnerabilities

The security vulnerabilities in your project are due to outdated dependencies. Here's how to fix them:

### 1. Updated Dependencies

I've updated the following packages in `package.json`:

- **OpenAI**: `^3.2.1` â†’ `^4.98.0` (Major version update)
- **Nodemon**: `^2.0.22` â†’ `^3.1.10` (Major version update)

### 2. Breaking Changes

#### OpenAI v4 Changes
The OpenAI library has significant API changes from v3 to v4:

```javascript
// OLD (v3)
import { Configuration, OpenAIApi } from 'openai';
const openai = new OpenAIApi(new Configuration({ apiKey: 'key' }));
const response = await openai.createChatCompletion({...});

// NEW (v4)
import OpenAI from 'openai';
const openai = new OpenAI({ apiKey: 'key' });
const response = await openai.chat.completions.create({...});
```

### 3. Steps to Update

Run these commands in the backend directory:

```bash
# Method 1: Clean install (recommended)
rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
npm install

# Method 2: Use the provided script
chmod +x update-dependencies.sh
./update-dependencies.sh

# Method 3: Force update (alternative)
npm audit fix --force
```

### 4. Verification

After updating, verify the fixes:

```bash
npm audit
```

You should see a significant reduction or complete elimination of high-severity vulnerabilities.

### 5. Testing

After the update, test your application:

```bash
# Start the backend
npm run dev

# Verify API endpoints are working
curl http://localhost:5000/api/health
```

### 6. Environment Variables

Make sure your `.env` file has the correct OpenAI API key if you're using the LLM features:

```
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
```

## ðŸ“‹ Summary of Vulnerabilities Fixed

1. **Axios CSRF & SSRF vulnerabilities** - Updated through OpenAI v4
2. **Semver ReDoS vulnerability** - Fixed by updating Nodemon
3. **OpenAI dependency chain** - Resolved with v4 upgrade

The updated code maintains the same functionality while using the latest secure versions of all dependencies.
